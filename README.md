# ü¶ô Features

* **Chat History**: create, delete and edit model settings per-chat.
* **Multimodality**: easily use vision capabilities of any multimodal model, such as [LLaVA](https://ollama.com/library/llava).
* **Ollama**: no need to install new inference engines, connect to a regular [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance instead.
* **Resource Efficient**: minimal RAM and CPU usage.
* **Free**: no need to buy any subscriptions or servers, just fire up a local Ollama instance.

# ü¶ô Quickstart

1. Download the latest Ellama release from the [Releases](https://github.com/zeozeozeo/ellama/releases) page.
   * or build & install from source:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/zeozeozeo/ellama.git
        cd ellama
        cargo install --path .
        ```
2. In the Settings ‚öôÔ∏è tab, change the Ollama host if needed (default is `http://127.0.0.1:11434`)
3. In the same tab, select a model that will be used for new chats by default. Ellama will try to select the best model on the first run.
4. Close the Settings tab, create a new chat by pressing the "‚ûï New Chat" button, and start chatting!
5. To add images, click the ‚ûï button next to the text field, drag them onto Ellama's window, or paste them from your clipboard.

# ü¶ô Wishlist

These features are not yet present in Ellama, but they would be nice to have:

* Support OpenAI-Compatible APIs: currently only has Ollama support
* A "Notes" section, where you can edit and write LLM-asissted notes
* Publish on crates.io: currently still relies on some git dependencies
